# Autoencoder Reconstruction of MNIST and CIFAR-10

This project implements a convolutional autoencoder with a shared encoder and
two separate decoders to reconstruct MNIST and CIFAR-10 images from a combined
mean input.

> This project was originally developed as part of a university course.

## Highlights
- Convolutional autoencoder with dual decoders
- Image preprocessing and dataset alignment
- Evaluation using SSIM and PSNR metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
